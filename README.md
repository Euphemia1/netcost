LT Software Website

Overview
--------
This repository contains a simple PHP (no framework) company website scaffold for LT Software. It uses MySQL for the contact form and a small admin "News Flash" section.

Tech stack
----------
- PHP 7.4+ (or 8.x)
- MySQL / MariaDB
- Bootstrap 5 (via CDN)
- Minimal custom CSS/JS

Quick setup
-----------
1. Copy the repo to your webroot (Hostinger public_html or similar).
2. Create a MySQL database and user. Note the credentials.
3. Edit `includes/db.php` and update `$DB_HOST`, `$DB_NAME`, `$DB_USER`, `$DB_PASS`.
4. Import the SQL schema: `sql/init.sql` into your database. For example using the command line or phpMyAdmin.

   Example (MySQL client):

   mysql -u root -p
   USE lt_software;
   SOURCE /path/to/sql/init.sql;

5. Create an admin user:
   - Option A (recommended): visit `/admin/create_admin.php` once, create a username/password, then delete that file for security.

Security improvements added:
- CSRF tokens for admin add/delete flows and admin account creation. Tokens are stored in session and verified for POST requests.
- Basic session-based login rate limiting: after several failed attempts the login is temporarily locked.

If you want stronger protections, consider adding IP-based rate limiting, account lockouts persisted in DB, and per-form CSRF tokens with expiry.
   - Option B: insert a row into `admins` with a password_hash generated by PHP.

6. Make sure your webserver points to the folder and that PHP is enabled.

Notes for Hostinger deploy
--------------------------
- Use Hostinger's control panel to create a MySQL database and user.
- Update `includes/db.php` with Hostinger credentials.
- Upload files to `public_html` (or the domain folder).
   - Ensure `admin/create_admin.php` is removed after creating admin account.

Security notes
--------------
- This scaffold uses prepared statements and password hashing, but it's minimal. For production:
  - Serve over HTTPS
  - Harden session settings
  - Add CSRF protection to admin forms
  - Rate-limit admin login attempts

Next steps and improvements
---------------------------
- Add edit/update for news items (currently add & delete implemented)
- Add pagination for news
- Replace placeholder images
- Add contact email notifications
- Add unit/functional tests if desired
